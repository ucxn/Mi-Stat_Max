**Real-time Monitoring**: Total WAN traffic (3s refresh), per-device speeds (3s interval), and official per-device traffic subtotals since boot (resume from history anytime). *Note: Dual-WAN defaults to an aggregated sum (an inherent fallback, not by specific design).*</br>
**Advanced Calculus**: True WAN speed (derived via differential calculus) and per-device traffic (via ∫ integration), displayed in a dual-track comparison alongside official stats! Plug-and-play!</br>
**Data Scopes**: Simultaneously compares: Official hardware readings (current session only), real-time online data, and cumulative totals since page load.</br>
**Core Features**: WAN/LAN Ratio via tri-source smart arbitration; Event-driven traffic calculus; Ultra-fast true WAN speed rendering; Smart unit conversion & standardization; Instant data availability on launch—no background idling required.</br>
**Dashboard UI**: Displays device name, uptime, IPv4, and connected interface. Features high-precision Up/Down speeds and ratios (dual-color indicators), historical upload / current download ratios against total network traffic (independent red/blue progress bars), and dynamic speed bars.

This script reconstructs the UI layout of the "Network Management" and "Connected Devices" pages via a self-built panel. It introduces trapezoidal integration algorithms, an abnormal traffic radar, and a dual-track traffic alignment display, providing a dashboard for network engineers and power users. Theoretically supports all Xiaomi WiFi 6/7 routers.

Router Web UI Enhancement × Mi Home Probe Linkage Integration (by "Brother Tech/哥哥科技"). Home Assistant plugin integration & UI enhancement, Mi Home Companion, supports the entire MiWiFi series!

Separately tracks uplink and downlink traffic, displays traffic ratio and up/down proportions, and combats P2P/PCDN upstream leeching. Supports mutiple base systems and Mbps/GiB units. Enables global comparison between LAN and WAN traffic! Features a flattened device list for instant big-screen visualization. Everything you need is right here—no more tedious menu switching...

While the official Web dashboard is stable, its UX design for data visualization has some friction. For instance, real-time network speeds and historical accumulated traffic for devices are hidden behind secondary menus. You have to frequently click into specific devices to view them, making it impossible to form an intuitive, global comparison. The core purpose of this plugin is to "flatten" these hierarchies. It extracts the up/down network speeds of individual devices, the integrated traffic during the current session, and the underlying total accumulated throughput, pushing them all to the forefront of the main device list. Without any extra clicks, the network throughput status of all devices is clear at a glance.

## ✨ Features

* **🏠 Home Assistant Integration**: Works seamlessly with the dedicated Brother Tech hub integration to push real-time status updates via Webhooks. This gracefully bypasses the single-session limitation of the native Web UI, enabling stable, concurrent multi-terminal concurrent monitoring. See the brother project (Universal): [Mi-Stat_HA](https://github.com/ucxn/ZTE-Stat_HA).
* **Traffic & Ratio Statistics**: Tracks the uplink and downlink traffic of individual devices separately, allowing you to view real-time traffic ratio rates and up/down proportions. Adding LAN/WAN Ratio, etc.
* **Abnormal Upload Monitoring**: Detects up/down ratios and visually flags abnormal uploads, combating PCDN / P2P bandwidth theft.
* **Precise Unit Conversion**: Strictly differentiates between network transmission rates and storage capacity. Supports both 1000/1024 base systems and displays in Mbps / GiB.
* **Global Data Comparison**: Supports aggregate statistics and intuitive comparison between the internal network (LAN algebraic sum) and the public network (WAN port).
* **High-Precision Integral Traffic Tracking ⏱️ & UI Grid Refactoring 🖥️**：Fully mobile-friendly
* **Dual-Track Traffic Comparison**: In addition to displaying the historical total throughput natively provided by the router interface, the frontend independently conducts high-frequency data sampling to track the actual traffic consumed while the page is open. Both metrics are displayed side-by-side for reference. Units are unified to the current session, focusing on the observability of changes.
* **Customization Support**: Respects network engineering habits by allowing script variables to customize display logic for Base-1000 (Mbps) and Base-1024 (MiB/s).
* **🛡️ Privacy Protection & UI Optimization**:
  * Automatically masks sensitive MAC addresses and temporary IPv6 addresses during in-place DOM mutation rendering, ensuring safety when screen recording, capturing, or sharing network status.
  * Employs a forced bottom-alignment system based on Flexbox, fixing height discrepancies caused by CSS grids.
  * Trace-less injection. Does not break the native Vue state machine, ensuring browser rendering performance.
* **:rainbow: Event-driven**: Optimises the integration algorithm to prevent miscalculations of flow area caused by misaligned sampling times or phase differences. Uses changes in network speed as the basis for the sampling interval.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Alternative Wake-up Entry**: If it isn't working, please check the **left sidebar navigation**, find the **🚀 哥哥科技面板（BroTech Panel）**, and click to open it; the functionality is essentially the same.<br> <br> Please ensure the **Tampermonkey** extension is running correctly!! Specifically, the extension icon in your browser should be displaying a number! The tutorial for allowing userscript injection is shown in the image below.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The script exposes a global `CONFIG` object at the top, allowing users to fine-tune it according to their specific network environment:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    calcMode: 1,            // 1: Absolute multiplier mode (Uplink/Downlink), 0: Traditional percentage mode
    ratioExtremeUp: 10,     // Extreme upload trigger threshold (default > 1000%, triggers red ⚠️ alert)
    ratioWarnUp: 0.07,      // Heavy upload trigger threshold (default > 7%, triggers red highlight)
    ratioExtremeDown: 0.01, // Extreme download trigger threshold (default < 1%, triggers blue download multiplier display)
    
    // Chinese mapping dictionary for physical ports and wireless bands (can be customized based on your router model)
    portMap: {
        "eth1": "Port 1",
        "eth2": "Port 2",
        "eth3": "Port 3",
        "eth4": "Port 4",
        "wl0":  "Wi-Fi 2.4G",
        "wl1":  "Wi-Fi 5.2G",
        "wl2":  "Wi-Fi 5.8G"
    }
};
```

## ⚠️ Notes

* This script is a pure frontend data reorganization tool. It does not involve modifying the Xiaomi router's underlying firmware.
Utilizing the Tampermonkey environment, the script makes concurrent requests to the router's `vue_home_device_data_no_update_sess` and `vue_client_data` APIs. To eliminate the lag caused by the official frontend's polling refresh, the script internally implements an independent timer via `performance.now()`, deriving highly accurate instantaneous traffic data. All UI modifications are executed via DOM Mutation on top of the original page's CSS framework, ensuring a native feel and seamless compatibility.
